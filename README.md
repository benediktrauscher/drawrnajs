[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/drawrnajs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/drawrnajs)

> Visualizes RNA secondary structures.

DrawrnaJS
==========

To install the module, use: 'npm install drawrnajs'

DrawrnaJS visualises RNA secondary structures in Dot-bracket notation. It is heavily based on [cytoscape.js](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js). The algorithm used for layout determination is deterministic and will therefore always provide the same visualisation for a specific secondary structure.

####  Features
* Deterministic layout
* Residues can be coloured according to type
* Precise selection and colouring via a lasso tool
* Interactive mode for hydrogen bond adding
* Export structure as PNG

## Use DrawrnaJS

Please refer to the examples, which show several possible ways of how you could embed DrawrnaJS into your page.

#### Initialisation

```javascript
var Rna = require("drawrnajs");

var app = new Rna({
    el: yourDiv,
    seq: "<your RNA sequence>",
    dotbr: "<your secondary structure>",
    /* ... */
})
app.render();

var defaults = {
    layout: "naview", //the only layout that is currently supported
    seqpanel: true, //determines whether there is going to be a sqeuence panel
    optspanel: true, //determines whethere there is going to be an options panel
    resindex: true //determines whether residue indices are shown
}
```
#### Set sequence and structure

```javascript
app.struct.get("seq") //get RNA sequence
app.struct.get("dotbr") //get structure
app.struct.set("seq", "ACGUACGAUCGUA") //set new sequence
```

#### Get the cytoscape element

```javascript
var cy = app.vis.cy //location of the cytoscape element
```

#### Add new bonds

```javascript
app.struct.get("links").newBond("12", "23") //creates a new bond between residues 12 and 23
```

#### Change the type of a bond

```javascript
app.vis.changeBondType("1to7", "non-canonical") //change the bond type of bond with 
                                                //bond-id "1to7" to non-canonical
```

#### Add a new non-canonical bond without re-calculating the layout

```javascript
app.vis.addNCBond(12, 23) //creates a new bond between residues 12 and 23 
                          //without re-calculating the layout algorithm
```

#### Set Leontis-Westhof nomenclature for bond

```javascript
app.vis.setLeontisWesthof("2to7", "sghgtrans") //sets Leontis-Westhof nomenclature
                                               //of non-canonical bond "2to7" to "sghgtrans"
```

The Leontis-Westhof nomenclature classes are formatted as follows

```javascript
lwClasses = [
    "wcwccis",
    "wcwctrans",
    "sgsgcis",
    "sgsgtrans",
    "hghgcis",
    "hghgtrans",
    "sghgcis",
    "sghgtrans",
    "hgsgcis",
    "hgsgtrans"
    //etc.
]
```
The first two charcters define the bond edge of residue 1, the second two characters define the ond edge of residue 2 and the rest of the class labels is either cis or trans. Bond edges are one of the following: wc (Watson-Crick), hg (Hoogsteen) or sg (Sugar).

#### Layouts

Currently the "naview" layout, which is a JavaScript port of [VARNA](http://varna.lri.fr/)'s NAView layout, is used for all the example structures. 
We intend to implement other layouts in the future.
